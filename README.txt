PHP iAddressBook is an address book for a single user that aims at 100%
compatibility with the AddressBook application in Mac OS X. It provides
a very intuitive interface and a powerful search function similar to that
found in Apples AddressBook. You can import and export your contacts using
the vCard format. The Import/Export functions work completely transparent
meaning that all data entered in the addressbook is exported to the vCard
and can be imported again.
