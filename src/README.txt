PHP iAddressBook is an address book for a single user. It supports
Personal or Business Cards supporting tons of different fields, is searchable,
supports categories, has transparent vCard import/export, contains
multilanguage support, design templates and an intuitive interface.
Besides that it aims at 100% compatibility to the AddressBook found
in Mac OS X.
