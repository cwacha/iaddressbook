==== Installation ====

Installing the address book consists of four steps:

  - Copy all files to your web space
  - Open your web browser and point it to your installation.
    You will be automatically redirected to the first time installation
  - Follow the steps in the installer
  - If you want authorization support enable it during the installation.
    You need to manually create users in conf/auth.php for now. You will
    find instructions in conf/auth.php.


==== Upgrade ====

The easiest way to upgrade is to use the vCard export feature to get all your contacts
and then import these contacts into a new installation. You won't lose any data as the
vCard export preserves all fields!

Follow these steps and you should be on the safe side:

  - Export all your contacts using the vCard export.
  - Install the addressbook as described in the installation chapter.
  - Import your vCard into the new addressbook. Use the "folder import" feature if you
    have a lot of contacts.
  - If everything works as expected, remove the old installation and rename/move your
    new installation to the old place.
