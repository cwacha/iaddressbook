Translation How-To:

CREATE A NEW TRANSLATION
------------------------

Create a copy of lang/en/lang.php and translate it into your language.
Make sure you use the ENGLISH version as it is the most up to date language.

UPDATE AN OLD TRANSLATION
-------------------------

Translation files are checked automatically against the english version.
All languages that need to be updated can be found in /lang/*.php. I.e. if
the spanish language file needs to be updated a file called /lang/es.php
will exist. The strings that are new are prefixed with the string
"TRANSLATE: ". Just send me the file at <clemens.wacha@gmx.net> and I
will include it in the next release.
