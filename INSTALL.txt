==== Installation ====

Installing the address book consists of four steps:

  - create a new database called "addressbook"
  - run the included SQL script in your database (see conf/*.sql)
  - make a copy of conf/config.php.dist or create you own conf/config.php (for a list
    of all available configuration parameters see conf/defaults.php). The settings
    in conf/config.php override those in conf/defaults.php.
  - if you want authorization support make a copy of auth.php.dist into auth.php and
    add usernames and passwords as needed. Don't forget to enable authentication in
    your config.php


==== Upgrade ====

The easiest way to upgrade is to use the vCard export feature to get all your contacts
and then import these contacts into a new installation. You won't lose any data as the
vCard export preserves all fields!

Follow these steps and you should be on the safe side:

  - Export all your contacts using the vCard export.
  - Read the changelog (check for changed database layout or other incompatibilities).
  - create a parallel installation of the addressbook and copy your old conf/config.php
    file to the new installation.
  - Rename/Drop your database
  - Create a completely new database using the SQL scripts in the conf folder.
  - if you have a customized template you will have to migrate it manually. I still
    have to make minor changes in the default templates. Best bet would be to "diff"
    the old default template with the new one to see if anything has changed. 
  - Import your vCard into the new database. Use the "folder import" feature if you
    have very big vCards.
  - If everything works as expected, remove the old installation and rename/move your
    new installation to the old place.
