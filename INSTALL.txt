==== Installation ====

Installing the address book consists of four steps:

  - create a new database called //addressbook//
  - create three new tables inside this database called "addressbook",
    "addressbook_cat" and "addressbook_catmap" using the template found in the root
    directory of the archive (addressbook.sql)
  - make a copy of conf/config.php.dist or create you own conf/config.php (for a list
    of all available configuration parameters see conf/defaults.php). The settings
    in conf/config.php override those in conf/defaults.php.
  - if you want authorization support make a copy of auth.php.dist into auth.php and
    add usernames and passwords as needed.


==== Upgrade ====

Upgrading is always tricky since you have to make sure that no personal configuration
data is accidently overridden. I tried to separate the default configuration settings
from your personal settings to make updating as easy as possible. The data-format
for your contacts in the database is stable (even for upcoming categories). Your
contacts will always remain safe in the database and are not affected by an upgrade.
There is no need to create a new database if you are upgrading.


Follow these steps and you should be on the safe side:

  - Read the changelog (check for changed database layout or other incompatibilities).
  - create a parallel installation of the addressbook and copy your old conf/config.php
    file to the new installation.
  - if you have a customized template you will have to migrate it manually. I still
    have to make minor changes in the default templates. Best bet would be to //diff//
    the old default template with the new one to see if anything has changed. 
  - if everything works as expected, remove the old installation and rename/move your
    new installation to the old place.
